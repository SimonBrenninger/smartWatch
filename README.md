# smartWatch

is a simple, digital wristwatch that uses LEDs to indicate the position of each clock arm.

## Smart Features

The smartWatch incorporates an nRF52810 to handle BLE connectivity for sending the monitored data regularly to the smartphone host.

## Future Features

In a future revision i'd love to add a biomedical sensor to enable even more smart functionalities i.e. SpO2 and heart-rate measurements.
